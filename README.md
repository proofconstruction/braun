# Braun
## A framework for model training

Braun is a Python library designed to facilitate training many machine learning models at once, using [https://github.com/sparkfish/augraphy](Augraphy)-generated data.

Braun requires Python 3.8 or higher, and additionally depends on `git` to clone the [https://github.com/sparkfish/shabby-pages](Shabby Pages) repository, which contains the Augraphy pipeline definition used to generate training data.

The library is named for Gerrit and Frederik Braun, the founders of Miniatur Wunderland, the largest model railway attraction in the world.
